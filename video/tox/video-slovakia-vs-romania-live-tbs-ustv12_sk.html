Stating the bleeding obvious here, but it should be said that this is a big deal for both nations. Romania have only qualified once for the last 16 in their five Euro appearances and that was in 2000. Regardless of whether they qualify as group winners or scrape through as one of the four best third-placed teams, this would represent a huge achievement for Edward Iordanescu and co.

If you don’t count Slovakia’s record as 1976 champions CzechoSlovakia, they have only reached the Euros twice as an independent nation, including back in 2016 where they reached the knockouts before being dispatched by semi-finallists Germany 3-0 in the round of 16. If you do count Slovakia’s record as 1976 champions CzechoSlovakia, and you probably should, this is their sixth appearance at the finals.
