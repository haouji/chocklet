Serbia, meanwhile, were just seconds away from likely elimination having trailed Denmark in the latter stages of extra time last week after an initial battling loss to England in Gelsenkirchen, before Luka Jovic’s last-gasp effort rescued a thrilling draw to keep their knockout qualification hopes alive. Dragan Stojkovic’s side need to beat Denmark really, though a draw might still be sufficient if Denmark do not upset England. Serbia cannot lose tonight and hope to progress.

Czechia have won just one of their past eight European Championship group stage fixtures – 2-0 against Scotland three years ago – but that's the task that awaits Ivan Hasek's side on Wednesday. They reached the last 16 then and much will again rest on star forward Patrik Schick, who scored the equalizer against Georgia last time out, his sixth in tournament history more than any other Czech player since 1991, if they're to repeat the feat.

Turkey, meanwhile, should progress as one of the best third-placed teams even in defeat after their opening 3-1 win against Georgia, but a point guarantees matters. Teenage Real Madrid playmaker Arda Guler was surprisingly on the bench last time out against Portugal and is likely to return to Vincenzo Montella's XI for this one following a chastening 3-0 reverse.
